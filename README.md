## Approach

Scroll element for table:

Through adding a div container around the table data, it was possible to create a scroll function by using an overflow command in the scss file.

By calling a hover command in the scss part that describes a table row, a row gets highlighted by hovering on it with the cursor.

Style changes:

By using variables in the scss file to define the general style of the font and the common colours used in the design, they are easier to adjust throughout the whole program.

By giving certain HTML tags id's and classes it was possible to give them scss attributes and protecting these from impacting each other.

## Ideas:

Table:

- You click on one person see a pop up window of graphics of their data 
- Multiple pop up windows are possible to compare different users quickly.
- A filter option to display the categories the user wants to see in the table.
- Small icons next to top row category names.
- Filter option to select customer with certain data from the table.
- Change the data in the json file through the table.
- Get the average income or trait for a profession and reverse.

Graphics:

- A pie chart of age groups(18-24, 25-30, 31-35 etc.), gender, martial status, the social stratification.
